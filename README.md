# bubbablox installer for linux
</div>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/dwwxLdxn/ss.png">

## installation:
1. run the script as root - ```sudo bash bbblox-linux.sh```
2. watch it do everything for you
3. done you can now join a game with the website

## FAQ:
1. what do i do if .NET installation fails
- uhh idk install it manually or something theres a choice for that in the script
2. why does the script need root?
- package managers, yeah i could've made it so it only asks for root perms only when it needs to install a package but i'm too lazy to rewrite the script

## bye
